# A module to be used in place of FFI::Library. It acts mostly
# like FFI::Library, but with some nice extra features and
# conveniences to make life easier:
# 
# * attach_function accepts TypedPointers as return type,
#   in which case it wraps the return value of the bound function
#   in the TypedPointer's type.
