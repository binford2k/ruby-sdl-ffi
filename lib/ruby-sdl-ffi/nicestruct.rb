require 'ffi'


# A class to be used as a baseclass where you would use FFI::Struct.
# It acts mostly like FFI::Struct, but with nice extra features:
# 
# * Automatically defines read and write accessor methods (e.g. #x,
#   #x=) for all struct members when you call #layout.
# 
# * Implements a nicer #new method which allows you to create a new
#   struct and set its data in one shot by passing an Array, Hash, or
#   another instance of the class (to copy data). You can also use it
#   to wrap a FFI::MemoryPointer just like you can with FFI::Struct.
#
# * Implements #to_ary and #to_hash to dump the struct data.
# 
# * Implements #to_s and #inspect for nice debugging output.
# 
class NiceStruct < FFI::Struct

  class << self

    # Same syntax as FFI::Struct#layout, but also defines nice
    # accessors for the attributes.
    # 
    # Example:
    # 
    #   class Rect < NiceStruct
    #     layout( :x, :int16,
    #             :y, :int16,
    #             :w, :uint16,
    #             :h, :uint16 )
    # 
    def layout( *spec )
      # Wrap the members.
      0.step(spec.size - 1, 2) { |index|
        wrap_member( spec[index], spec[index+1])
      }

      # Normal FFI::Struct behavior
      super
    end


    private


    # Defines read and write accessors for the given struct member.
    # This is similar to attr_accessor, except these accessors read
    # and write the struct's members, instead of to instance
    # variables.
    # 
    # E.g. `wrap_member(:x, :int16)` defines #x and #x= read and write
    # to the struct's :x member, which is an int16.
    # 
    # Normally you don't need to call this method, because #layout
    # does this automatically.
    # 
    # Currently this method doesn't do anything with the type parameter,
    # but in the future it might perform some type checks in the write
    # accessor.
